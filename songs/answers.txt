The listener is above average energy,
has a average valence and high danceability.
They are on the move a lot and energetic.

They could be purple, yellow or maybe even orange.
There is no valid conclusion in sight.
It is unknown what the user felt when they listened to each individual song.
It is unclear, why each song has been added to the playlist. They may be a one-off,
they could have been recommended, it could have been something they opened randomly
and enjoyed in that particular moment of that time of the day.

The aura could possibly be calculated better by taking
into account these factors:
- most listened to / most repeated / most rewinded songs
- if the user's energy level was known at the time of playback
- if the user could track their mood (i. e. selectable emoji depicting after a song has concluded)
